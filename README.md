Binary Flipplin -- Binary Bangers


Fix the lyrics First to get their pulled request wins!

[Verse] Start with a number, anything will do, Gotta break it down, bring it to the crew. Divide by two, remainders in sight, Stack 'em up tall, digits take flight.

[Chorus] Zeros and ones, coding like a pro, Turn base 10, break it down slow. Binary flow, digital on deck, Watch me flex, conversion so tech.

[Verse 2] One One Zero, that's a three in disguise, Four's just one-zero-zero, no surprise. Five's got a ring, one-zero-one bling, Encode the numbers, hear the bytes sing.

[Bridge] Count 'em, calculate, algorithm slick, Tech cypher sharp, binary quick. Switch 'em, flip 'em, binary waves, Digital hustle, modern-day craze.

[Verse 3] Six is one-one-zero, binary thrill, Seven stacks up, one-one-one, chill. Eight's a fresh start, one-zero-zero-zero bit, Nine's one-zero-zero-one, making it lit.

[Chorus] Zeros and ones, coding like a pro, Turn base 10, break it down slow. Binary flow, digital on deck, Watch me flex, conversion so tech.
