Binary Flipplin -- Binary Bangers


Fix the lyrics First to get their pulled request wins!

[Verse]
Zeros and ones they dance in the night 01
Flickering lights they shine so bright
In the binary world it's all black and white
Positive or negative ain't no fight

[Verse 2]
Flip the bits and add a one 101
Two's complement starts the fun 
Negative numbers aren't that dumb
Just rearranged under the binary sun

[Chorus]
Binary love flip the bits and go 010
Negative feelings simply overflow 
From zero down to thirty-two (000000 to 111111)
In the end it’s all just ones and zeros (101010)

[Verse 3]
If you see a leading one
That’s how you know it's begun
Negative numbers on the run
Counting down till they’re done

[Bridge]
32 bits in a row (00000000000000000000000000000000)
High to low they neatly flow (01111111111111111111111111111111)
From -2^31 to the thirty-one (10000000000000000000000000000000 to 00000000000000000000000000011111)
All compacted in this binary show (11110010110101001010101010101010)

[Chorus]
Binary love flip the bits and go 
Negative feelings simply overflow
From zero down to thirty-two
In the end it’s all just ones and zeros
