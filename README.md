[Verse] 
Zeros and ones dance in the night, Flickering lights shine so bright. In the binary world, it's black and white, Positive or negative, calculations right.

[Verse 2] 
Flip the bits and add a one, Two's complement starts the fun. Negative values aren't just dumb, Just inverted under the binary sun.

[Chorus] 
Binary love, flip the bits and go, Negative values overflow. From zero up to thirty-two, In the end, it’s all just ones and zeros.

[Verse 3] 
If you see a leading one, That’s how you know it's begun. Negative numbers on the run, Counting down until they’re done.

[Bridge] 
Thirty-two bits in a row, High to low, they neatly flow. From minus two to the thirty-one, All packed tight in this binary show.

[Chorus] 
Binary love, flip the bits and go, Negative values overflow. From zero up to thirty-two, In the end, it’s all just ones and zeros.
