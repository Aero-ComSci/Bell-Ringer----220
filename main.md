[Verse 1]
Start with a number, anything it'll do,
Gotta break it down, bring it to the crew.
Divide by two, remainder in your sights,
Stack 'em up tall, digits taking flight.

[Chorus]
O and 1, coding like a pro,
Turning base 2, break it down slow.
Binary flow, digital on deck,
Watch me flex, conversion so tech.

[Verse 2]
0-1-1, that's a three in disguise,
Four’s just 1-0-0, woke up to fries.
Five got a ring, 1-0-1 bling,
Encode the numbers, hear the bytes sing.

[Bridge]
Count 'em, calculate, algorithm slick,
Tech cypher, be sharp and quick.
Switch 'em, flip 'em, binary waves,
Digital hustle, modern day slaves.

[Verse 3]
1-1-0, six in disguise,
Seven stacks up, 1-1-1, rise.
Eight’s a fresh start, 1-0-0-0 bit,
Nine’s 1-0-0-1, making it lit.

[Chorus]
O and 1, coding like a pro,
Turning base 2, break it down slow.
Binary flow, digital on deck,
Watch me flex, conversion so tech.
