Binary Flipplin -- Binary Bangers

Fix the lyrics First to get their pulled request wins!

[Verse] Zeros and ones they dance in the night Flickering lights they shine so bright In the binary world it's all black and white Positive or negative ain't no fight

[Verse 10] Flip the bits and add a one Two's complement starts the fun Negative numbers aren't that dumb Just rearranged under the binary sun

[Chorus] Binary love flip the bits and go Negative feelings simply overflow From zero down to thirty-two In the end it’s all just ones and zeros

[Verse 11] If you see a leading one That’s how you know it's begun Negative numbers on the run Counting down till they’re done

[Bridge] 32 bits in a row High to low they neatly flow From -2^31 to the 31 All compacted in this binary show

[Chorus] Binary love flip the bits and go Negative feelings simply overflow From zero down to thirty-two In the end it’s all just ones and zeros

Thanks to Akshat Agrawal for the bit about the -2^31.
